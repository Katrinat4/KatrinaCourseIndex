		[Chorus] <br>
		'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
		We're dancing â€˜round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
		Down the stairs, I was there
		I remember it all too well, yeah
		<br> <br>
		[Bridge] <br>
		Well maybe we got lost in translation
		Maybe I asked for too much
		But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
		'Til you tore it all up
		Running scared, I was there
		I remember it all too well
		And you call me up again
		Just to break me like a promise
		So casually cruel in the name of being honest
		I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
		'Cause I remember it all, all, all
		Too well
